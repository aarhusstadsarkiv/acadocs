How to remove multiple entries specified in a csv-file:

2. In SAM go to "Admin Panel"/"Delete OAS"

3. Place VS Code in the left side of the screen by pressing windows key + left key

4. In VS Code open the AutoGui repo and specify the path to the csv-file.

5. Standard screensize is 1920x1200, if not this size use the while-loop in the code to find the screen coordinates of the buttons in SAM for the delete entry process.
